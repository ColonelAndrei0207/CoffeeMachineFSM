1.Main objective

   This project is looking to implement a small-scale main computer of a coffe machine. This state machine should recieve inputs from the user and from the main
components of the device. 

2. Thought process
   
   I have designed the circut to recieve information from the user, through small impulses. I am considering that the user is either looking to make himself a 
small espresso, a double espresso, or a coffee with milk. These parameters are set and control through registers in the circut that, in theory, are linked to the 
entire system.
